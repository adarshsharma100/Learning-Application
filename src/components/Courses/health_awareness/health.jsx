        Health refers to the state of being free from illness or injury, while wellness takes a broader perspective, focusing on the active pursuit of a balanced and fulfilling life. Wellness incorporates various dimensions—physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual—that contribute to overall well-being. For example, someone might be physically healthy but still struggle with emotional wellness due to unmanaged stress. Recognizing the interplay of these dimensions helps individuals adopt holistic approaches to maintain and improve their quality of life.          </p><br/>

      Physical health is the foundation for overall wellness, enabling the body to function efficiently. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, swimming, or strength training, strengthens muscles, improves heart health, and enhances flexibility. Maintaining a healthy weight and eating a nutrient-rich diet prevent chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Additionally, prioritizing adequate sleep—7 to 9 hours for most adults—helps regulate hormones, repair tissues, and improve concentration. Investing in physical health boosts energy levels, productivity, and longevity.          </p><br/>

      Good nutrition fuels the body, providing energy and supporting bodily functions. A balanced diet includes macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). For instance, leafy greens and fruits provide essential antioxidants that fight free radicals, while proteins repair tissues and build muscles. Poor eating habits, such as overconsumption of processed foods or sugary drinks, can lead to weight gain, fatigue, and chronic illnesses. Mindful eating, which involves paying attention to hunger cues and savoring meals, encourages better food choices and overall wellness.        </p><br/>

      Mental health encompasses cognitive and emotional well-being, influencing how individuals think, feel, and behave. Emotional wellness involves recognizing, expressing, and managing feelings constructively. For example, someone practicing mindfulness might use deep breathing to calm themselves during stressful situations. Building strong coping mechanisms, such as journaling, meditation, or seeking therapy, helps manage anxiety and depression. Mental health stigma often prevents people from seeking help, but awareness and support systems encourage individuals to prioritize and address their emotional needs.         </p>
